# Raspberry Pi setup for running python & communicating with XBees :D

## Raspbian install & etc
1. Download system image [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
2. follow steps [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) to flash to SD card.
3. Done'd!

We have a couple of options on how to connect to the RasPi to get a hold of its command line:
- Connect a display and a keyboard
- Connect the device to a network and SSH in
- Use the GPIO pins to use serial communication through USB, with PuTTY, for example.

The default username is **pi** and the default password is **raspberry**
